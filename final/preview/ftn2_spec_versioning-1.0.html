FTN2: FutoIn Specification Versioning
Version: 1.0
Date: 2014-09-07
Copyright: 2014 FutoIn Project (http://futoin.org)
Authors: Andrey Galkin
</pre>

<h1>1. Version format</h1>
<p>There are two version components MAJOR and MINOR, separated by point.</p>
<p>For released specifications, both components are not negative integer number, monotonically increasing from zero.</p>
<pre><code>Example: 1.0, 1.1, 2.0
</code></pre>
<p>The latest up-to-date version in development/draft is to be marked with special "DV" component in place of MINOR, concatenated with draft number equal to the next
expected version.</p>
<pre><code>Example: 0.DV1, 1.DV1, 2.DV1, 2.DV2
</code></pre>
<h1>2. Linear Versioning</h1>
<p>FutoIn specification versioning is linear - no branching is allowed.</p>
<p>"(n+1).x" version is guaranteed to be newer than any "n.y", where x, y - any value</p>
<p>As exception, it is allowed to released new versions of previous MAJOR version until the first release of new MAJOR version</p>
<h2>2.1. Initial Specification Design</h2>
<p>MAJOR is set to 0, minor is incremented with every draft</p>
<h2>2.2. Initial Release</h2>
<p>MAJOR is set to 1, MINOR - to 0.</p>
<h2>2.3. Specification revise</h2>
<h3>2.3.1. Backward compatible draft</h3>
<p>Existing specification is updated and versioned as draft (MAJOR.DVn).
New version is released as "MAJOR.(MINOR+1)".</p>
<h3>2.3.2. Draft with broken backward compatibility</h3>
<p>Broken backward compatibility is versioned as "(MAJOR+1).DVn" and then releases as "(MAJOR+1).0".</p>
<p>The previous version should be available with "_vMAJOR" postfix/suffix in filename for easy accessibility purposes.</p>
<h1>3. Requirements for specification release</h1>
<ol>
<li>Specification must be approved (see note below)</li>
<li>At least one reference implementation must exist, if applicable</li>
<li>At least one full [automatic] test suite must exist, if applicable</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Note: Review &amp; Approval process is out of scope of this document.</em></p>
<h1>4. Backward compatibility</h1>
<p>"x.(n+1)" is guaranteed to be backward compatible with any "x.n". Specification bug fix is not subject for backward compatibility.</p>
<pre><code>Example: 1.1 with 1.0, 1.2 with 1.1 and 1.0, etc.
</code></pre>
<p>"(n+1).0" version increment is allowed only, if there is backward incompatible change.
Typically, such releases are allowed only after deep revise process to drop deprecated features.
Exception is when MAJOR=0 - initial development.</p>
<h1>5. Specification deprecation</h1>
<p>Whole specification can be marked deprecated, if its features are fully covered by another specification.
The goal is to avoid alternative specs for the same area.</p>
