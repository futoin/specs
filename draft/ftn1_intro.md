# 1. FutoIn Intro

FutoIn originally stays for *Fu*ll Au*to*mation *In*terface.

The idea of "Full Automation Interface" was born in scope of enterprise integration demand focusing on usage
of modern to the moment Web patterns. Quickly, the idea got further evolved to be used in rapidly changing Web
world as well. The major focus is on defining requirements, assumed processes and interoperability interfaces
for modularization on any level.

Of course, there are plenty of technology companies with advanced proprietary API features, but only some of
them are really standardized and open to public. User, Developers, Owners and even Governments become locked
in technology stack provided by large companies.

The ultimate goal is not only to define standards, but also to provide production-ready reference implementation,
which can be used in proprietary solutions.

# 2. Goals & Philosophy
1. Loose coupling of any system component on implementation-neutral protocol level, but not platform level or above
2. Alternative implementations are welcome
3. Backward compatibility is not a priority, but Migration path is one
4. Security has priority over usability
5. On demand revise and redesign is assumed, keeping a single interface for each area

# 3. Why ???
There are existing solutions, but they get bloated, redundant and overweighted with backward
compatibility over time. However, the main answer is "just for fun" and "for experience". There is no reasonable
economical or practical justification. The project is just "yet another alternative" in many cases.
However, this effort becomes meaningful in scope of larger programs not limited to IT.

# 4. Language and Translations
De facto, English in IT has become the same as what Latin is in Medicine. Therefore, I see *no reason for translations* in
this project. National-based fragmentation just provides enormous overhead and does not make developers closer. This project
unifies human communication interfaces in IT as well. *Note: and, just for clarity, I am not native English speaker.*
