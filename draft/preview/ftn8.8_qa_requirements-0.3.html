<h1>1. Intro</h1>
<p>This sub-specification of <a href="./ftn8_security_concept.html">FTN8</a> covers
Quality Assurance requirements/test cases in scope of FTN8.</p>
<p>As authentication &amp; authorization is one of fundamental aspects of
whole FutoIn project, it is very important to explicitely list all
essential test cases.</p>
<h1>2. Concept</h1>
<p>QA requirements are split into test suites under "Requirements" section.
Each section is organized in paragraph - test case written in style of
User or Job Story and starting from associative identifier.</p>
<p>Format:
<code>{SCOPE}-{ID} - {story}</code></p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p><strong>REQ-1</strong> - The requirement must be short and simple, so it can be easily covered
in single test case.</p>
<h1>3. Requirements</h1>
<h2>3.1. Stateless clear text authentication</h2>
<p>See <a href="./ftn8.1_stateless_auth.html">FTN8.1</a>.</p>
<p><em>Note: "STLCT" stays for STateLess Clear Text.</em></p>
<p>AuthService-related:</p>
<p><strong>STLCT-A1</strong> - STLCT authentication must be rejected, if it is not enabled in AuthService.</p>
<p><strong>STLCT-A2</strong> - STLCT authentication must be rejected, if User has no inidividual secret
configured for specific Service.</p>
<p><strong>STLCT-A3</strong> - STLCT authentication must be rejected, if User is not found.</p>
<p><strong>STLCT-A4</strong> - STLCT authentication must be rejected, if User secret for
specific Service mismatches.</p>
<p><strong>STLCT-A5</strong> - all STLCT rejections must have artificial delay to prevent time-based
User existence exposure.</p>
<p>Executor-related:</p>
<p><strong>STLCT-E1</strong> - Executor must send all available Client fingerprints to AuthService, so
it can enforce additional constraint checks.</p>
<p><strong>STLCT-E2</strong> - local and global user ID must be set in RequestInfo on accepted
authentication.</p>
<p><strong>STLCT-E3</strong> - "Info" security level must be set in RequestInfo on accepted
authentication.</p>
<h2>3.2. Stateless MAC authentication</h2>

<p><em>Note: "STLMC" stays for Stateless Message athentication Code.</em></p>
<p>AuthService-related:</p>
<p><strong>STLMC-A1</strong> - STLMC authentication must be rejected, if it is not enabled in AuthService.</p>
<p><strong>STLMC-A2</strong> - STLMC authentication must be rejected, if User has no inidividual secret
configured for specific Service.</p>

<p><em>Note: MSMAC states for Master Secret Message Authentication Code.</em></p>
<p>Invoker-related:</p>
<p><strong>MSMAC-I1</strong> - a new secure public/private key pair must get generated before every
new Secret exchange.</p>
<p><strong>MSMAC-I2</strong> - Invoker must always use peer GlobalServiceID as HKDF0 salt parameter.</p>
<p><strong>MSMAC-I3</strong> - Invoker must always use HKDF0-MAC strategy for message signing.</p>
<p><strong>MSMAC-I4</strong> - Invoker must always use HKDF0-EXPOSED strategy for payload signing
in untrusted delivery channel.</p>
<p><strong>MSMAC-I5</strong> - Invoker must always use a new HKDF-ENC strategy salt parameter for
encryption of any data.</p>
<p>Executor-related:</p>
<p><strong>MSMAC-E1</strong> - Executor must send all available Client fingerprints to AuthService, so
it can enforce additional constraint checks.</p>
<p><strong>MSMAC-E2</strong> - Executor must re-retrieve derived key from AuthService on
Client fingerprints change, if local key caching is used.</p>
<p><strong>MSMAC-E3</strong> - Executor must use the same derived key for signing of response as used
for signing of the related request.</p>
<p>AuthService-related:</p>
<p><strong>MSMAC-A1</strong> - AuthService must ensure that HKDF0 salt parameter matches GlobalServiceID
of validating Service to protect from easy key leaks.</p>
<p><strong>MSMAC-A2</strong> - AuthService may cache derived keys only after successfull authentication
of message to protect from DoS using wrong salt cache.</p>
<p><strong>MSMAC-A3</strong> - shared Secret must use random source of acceptable
quality for cryptographic purposes.</p>
<p><strong>MSMAC-A4</strong> - AuthService must allow up to two active Secrets per Service per Scope
to allow smooth new Secret rollout without interruptions.</p>
<p><strong>MSMAC-A5</strong> - AuthService must leave exactly the Secret used for signing the
exchange message as the old active key even when a newer one exists to
protected for errors during response of the exchange processing.</p>
<p><strong>MSMAC-A6</strong> - "PrivilegedOps" security level must be set in RequestInfo on accepted
authentication.</p>
<p><strong>MSMAC-A7</strong> - AuthService must expose derived key to Service only after related
authentication of data using the derived key to prevent easy key leaks.</p>
<p><strong>MSMAC-A8</strong> - AuthService must allow new key exchange only when signing key is
derived from Master Secret with empty of the same <code>scope</code> as requested for exchange.</p>
<h2>3.4. Client authentication</h2>
<p>See <a href="./ftn8.3_client_auth.html">FTN8.3</a>.</p>
<p><em>Note: CLCSA states for CLient Cookie Session Authentication.</em></p>
<p>Service-related:</p>
<p><strong>CLCSA-S1</strong> - Service must undoubtedly associate request with session cookie.</p>
<p><strong>CLCSA-S2</strong> - Service must forbid cross-domain requests based on HTTP 'Referal'
header whitelist, if applicable.</p>
<p><strong>CLCSA-S3</strong> - Service should forbid CORS requests with credentials.</p>
<p><strong>CLCSA-S4</strong> - Service must set session as "HTTP-only" to avoid API exposure.</p>
<p><strong>CLCSA-S5</strong> - Service must sign &amp; verify set cookies with private secret to
mitigate proxied AuthService DoS with forged sessions.</p>
<p><strong>CLCSA-S6</strong> - Service must limit cookie time-to-live based on signed timestamp
embedded in cookie value.</p>
<p><strong>CLCSA-S7</strong> - Executor must send all available Client fingerprints to AuthService, so
it can enforce additional constraint checks during session start/sesson resume.</p>
<p><strong>CLCSA-S8</strong> - Executor must start a new session after successfull Auth Query.</p>
<p><strong>CLCSA-S9</strong> - Executor must resume session with AuthService every 10 minutes or
more often while session is actively used.</p>
<p><strong>CLCSA-S10</strong> - Executor must force session resume with AuthService on every
Client fingerprints change.</p>
<p><strong>CLCSA-S11</strong> - Executor must check signature of all incoming redirects.</p>
<p><strong>CLCSA-S12</strong> - Executor must create "EXPOSED" signature of all outcoming redirects.</p>
<p>Client-related:</p>
<p><strong>CLCSA-C1</strong> - Client should support HTTP-only cookies.</p>
<p><strong>CLCSA-C2</strong> - Client should obey CORS.</p>
<p>AuthService-related:</p>
<p><strong>CLCSA-A1</strong> - AuthService must check signature of all incoming redirects.</p>
<p><strong>CLCSA-A2</strong> - AuthService must create "EXPOSED" signature of all outcoming redirects.</p>
<p><strong>CLCSA-A3</strong> - AuthService should support multi-factor authentication for Users.</p>
<p><strong>CLCSA-A4</strong> - AuthService must ensure that Auth Query belongs to requesting Service.</p>
<p><strong>CLCSA-A5</strong> - AuthService must ensure that session-related tokens are associated
to requesting Service.</p>
<p><strong>CLCSA-A6</strong> - AuthService must ask User based on Auth Query request, if requested access
has not been granted before.</p>
<p><strong>CLCSA-A7</strong> - AuthService should skip asking User based on Auth Query request, if
requested access has been granted before.</p>
<h2>3.5. Access Control</h2>
<p>See <a href="./ftn8.4_access_control.html">FTN8.4</a>.</p>
<p>Service-related:</p>
<p><strong>AC-S1</strong> - Service must check if User granted on-behalf-of call access to other User(Service).</p>
<p><strong>AC-S2</strong> - Service must process on-behalf-of calls as if called by target User.</p>
<p><strong>AC-S3</strong> - Service must check if User is allowed to make particular request.</p>
<p><strong>AC-S4</strong> - Service must properly invalidate local cache.</p>
<p>AuthService-related:</p>
<p><strong>AC-A1</strong> - AuthService should merge multiple ACDs so wider access eliminates more specialized.</p>
<p><strong>AC-A2</strong> - AuthService should merge multiple ACDs so different parameter whitelist get properly
merged into a single whitelist of unique values.</p>
<p><strong>AC-A3</strong> - AuthService must properly emit events on access changes, so listening Services could
invalidate own caches.</p>
<h2>3.6. Authentication rejection limits</h2>
