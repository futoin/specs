<h1>1. Intro</h1>
<p>There are many modern message exchange systems with quite unique features.
It is common to extend user service with intelligent agent (bot) functionality.</p>
<p>This specification is focused on generic message handling inside such service.</p>
<p>Text message processing is assumed. Speech recognition and synthesis is expected
to be communication channel (de-)modulation which ends in processing of textual
representation.</p>
<h1>2. Concept</h1>
<h2>2.1. Entity types</h2>
<p>A typical message exchange system has the following entity types:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Actors</strong> - users and bots which can send and receive messages from other Actors.</li>
<li><strong>Channels</strong> - peer-to-peer or peer-to-many communication for Actors.</li>
<li><strong>Server</strong> - a collection of Channels which possibly has administrative meaning.</li>
</ul>
<h2>2.2. Entity identification</h2>
<p>It is expected that Servers and Channels are identified by UUIDv4 which should be
mapped by adapter interfaces reliable safe way. That allows predictable internal
database schemes.</p>
<p>However, such approach is technically excessive for Actors. Therefore, message system
native unique identifier is expected to be used as arbitrary string of characters.</p>
<h2>2.3. Reactive message handling</h2>
<p>It is expected that bot reacts to other Actors messages. Therefore, a generic interface
for message handling is expected to receive input message as parameter and return response
message as result variable. For most cases, that should greatly simplify implementation.</p>
<h2>2.4. Unsolicited message push</h2>
<p>Sometimes, bot service needs to push additional messages as reaction to some internal event, or
as side reaction to message on a different communication channel.</p>
<p>Such message processing is expected to be one-way. The push interface must be available through
associated <a href="./ftn7_iface_invoker_concept.html">FTN7 CCM</a> instance.</p>
<h2>2.5. Message system integration</h2>
<p>It is expected that various bridge and adapter implementations exist to connect
custom message system protocol to the interface of this specification.</p>
<p>Such implementation is responsible for efficient entitity identifier mapping, and for proper
slicing of response messages to match any limits, including single message size and message throttling.</p>
<h2>2.6. Message system helpers</h2>
<p>Most likely, each message system has unique rich text formatting. It is assumed that universal
native API helpers are provided similar to <a href="./ftn17_if_database.html">FTN17 Database concept</a>.</p>
<h2>2.7. Message representation</h2>
<p>Every message is represented by related server ID, optional channel ID for group communication and payload.</p>
<p>Incoming messages has additional sender and timestamp fields.</p>
<p>Reactive message is just a payload to be sent into the source channel/private chat. Other fields
are deduced from the incoming message.</p>
<p>Push message may have optional recipient for private message.</p>
<h2>2.8. Chaining of message handlers</h2>
<p>It is expected that actual bot implementation uses middleware chain pattern for separation
of concerns during message processing. Each element is expected to have a single reactive
message interface.</p>
<p>By design, the next chain must be selected via associated CCM instead of direct native object
references or pointers to follow FutoIn microservice pattern.</p>

                                        |<strong><em>_</em></strong>|</p>
<p>```</p>
<h2>2.9. Command message router</h2>
<p>Traditional message bots support various commands of fixed format. Very often, such commands
are split by functionality into modular parts.</p>
<p>To support such command handling paradigm, a special message router is required to listen for
specially prefixed messages and route them into related message handler parts.</p>
<p>Custom extensions of such routers should be able to enforce access control for the commands. It should
be possible to create several message routers in general middleware chain way.</p>
<p>For efficiency and flexibility reasons, routed message must be stripped from a command command prefix.</p>
<p>Messages routed by prefix are expected to be sent only to respected handlers.
There must be support for traditional catch all handlers.</p>
<h2>2.10. CCM interface naming plan</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>#msgbot.</code> - general prefix for interfaces in scope of this specification</li>
<li><code>#msgbot.router</code> - main reactive message handler</li>
<li><code>#msgbot.push</code> - main push message handler</li>
<li><code>#msgbot.system.{UUIDB64}</code> - system interfaces</li>
</ul>
