FTN9: FutoIn burst call extension
Version: 0.1
Copyright: 2014 FutoIn Project (http://futoin.org)
Authors: Andrey Galkin
</pre>

<h1>1. Intro</h1>
<p>In some cases, its more effective to combine several calls into
a large one.</p>
<p>Possible use cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>In lack of WebSocket support, single HTTP request - multiple FutoIn calls</li>
<li>A set of events or log messages can be uploaded after original request
    has compelted execution</li>
<li>A state modifying request can be combined with information retrieval
    minimizing processing delay, by removed intermediate response-request part</li>
</ul>
<p>It should be possible to enable burst explicitly through API or
implicitly by Invoker implementation (e.g. for web pages).</p>
<p>Both Invoker and Executor must disable "AllowAnonymous", if any of invoking
interfaces lacks one. "SecureChannel" must be enabled, if any of invoking
interfaces has one set.</p>
<p>Note: message multiplexing must be enabled to match request and response messages</p>

<h1>3. Burst call API extension</h1>
<p>All messages between start() and finish() should be delayed. If there is more than one
request to the same end-point, then they should be wrapped into futoin.burst.resultBurst
or futoin.burst.noResultBurst, depending on interface definition.</p>
<p>Simple CCM can implement dummy start() and finish() without affecting regular flow.
<strong>Therefore, invoking code must not rely on side effects of batch processing.</strong></p>
<p>Burst can be used globally on CCM or on individual interfaces.</p>
<ul>
<li>start()</li>
<li>finish()</li>
</ul>
