<h1>1. Concept</h1>
<p>It is not a new concept, but standardization of higher level interface for
Host Security Modules and similar pure software or hardware components.</p>
<p>The main idea is that critical sensitive data is accessible only to a small peace of
software/hardware effectively limiting scope of source code, hardware design and/or
infrastructure required to be audited for security issues in first place. Most flaws in
other software parts of larger project should have less impact on sensitive data
disclosure.</p>
<p>Critical sensitive data: private or shared cryptography keys</p>
