# 1. Concept

It is not a new concept, but standardization of higher level interface for
Host Security Modules and similar pure software or hardware components.

The main idea is that critical sensitive data is accessible only to a small peace of
software/hardware effectively limiting scope of source code, hardware design and/or
infrastructure required to be audited for security issues in first place. Most flaws in
other software parts of larger project should have less impact on sensitive data
disclosure.

Critical sensitive data: private or shared cryptography keys
